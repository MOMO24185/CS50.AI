**CS50 AI Projects**

This repository contains projects completed as part of Harvard's **CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course. The course explores foundational AI concepts, including search algorithms, optimization, knowledge representation, reinforcement learning, and neural networks.

**Projects:**

**1. Degrees**
- **Concepts:** Graph Search Algorithms
- **Project:** Implemented a program to find the shortest path between two actors through their movie collaborations, demonstrating the concept of degrees of separation in a graph.

**2. Knights**
- **Concepts:** Logical Inference, Propositional Logic
- **Project:** Developed a model to solve logic puzzles involving knights and knaves, who either always tell the truth or always lie, respectively.

**3. Minesweeper**
- **Concepts:** Knowledge Representation, Logical Inference
- **Project:** Created an AI to play the game Minesweeper by inferring the locations of mines based on revealed board information.

**4. Nim**
- **Concepts:** Reinforcement Learning
- **Project:** Built an AI that learns to play the game Nim optimally through self-play and reinforcement learning techniques.

**5. PageRank**
- **Concepts:** Probability, Markov Models
- **Project:** Implemented the PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on their link structures, simulating the foundational algorithm used by search engines.

**6. Parser**
- **Concepts:** Natural Language Processing, Parsing
- **Project:** Developed a parser to analyze sentence structures, identifying noun phrases and their relationships within sentences.

**7. Shopping**
- **Concepts:** Machine Learning, Classification
- **Project:** Applied machine learning techniques to predict shopping behaviors based on user data, implementing models like k-nearest neighbors for classification.

**8. Tic-Tac-Toe**
- **Concepts:** Adversarial Search, Minimax Algorithm
- **Project:** Designed an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

**9. Traffic**
- **Concepts:** Computer Vision, Neural Networks
- **Project:** Trained a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs from images, demonstrating applications of deep learning in image recognition.

**10. Crossword**
- **Concepts:** Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- **Project:** Created an AI to generate crossword puzzles by filling in words on a grid based on given constraints.

**11. Heredity**
- **Concepts:** Probability, Bayesian Networks
- **Project:** Built a model to predict the likelihood of individuals possessing certain genetic traits based on family history.

**12. Attention**
- **Concepts:** Natural Language Processing, Attention Mechanisms
- **Project:** Implemented an attention mechanism to predict masked words in a sentence and visualize attention scores, enhancing understanding of context in language models.

**Tools & Libraries Used:**
- **Python** (primary language)
