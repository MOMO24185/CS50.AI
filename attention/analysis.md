# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 7

There is heavy attention between the "[MASK]" token and other tokens such as "eat", "lots", "today" and "she", "is", "going", "meeting" in the first and second example sentences respectively. This is likely showing how the model in this head is using the surrounding tokens to gain context of activies taking place and predicting what the missing word could be.

Example Sentences:
- I got to eat lots of [MASK] today after my tooth extraction.
- She is going [MASK] after her meeting.

## Layer 7, Head 5

The attention heatmap here seems to focus more on connecting tokens that emphasize the subject or purpose of certain actions, such as the relations between "alarm" and "for" or "done" and "to", which try to create a link to prepositions.

Example Sentences:
- They reminded me to go out for [MASK] tomorrow morning, and I made sure to set an alarm for it at the time.
- They managed to detain him before any more damage was done to the [MASK].
